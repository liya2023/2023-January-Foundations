                        <span>If you ask me what's my most unforgettable trip I had so far, I'd say Dubai and Jordan. I was mesmerized by the mysterious culture and buildings in the Middle East. The people, the food, the mosque, the red desert, the camping tent under the stars, the camel ride, the Burj Khalifa, the surprisingly beautiful beach right by the the palm islands and sailboat hotel, the morning prayer call. I was in an Arabian dream!</span>

                        <span> We believe each business is as unique as the countries we've visited. Recently Liya took on a barter business as her client. Getting to know the business and all the members in the barter network made her understand the social media needs better. Liya was able to design a schedule for the client and post 5 times a week to satisfy all the members' needs by the catogories.</span>
